## Description

I started the project with the landing page template that udacity gives us.

I made some changes in index.js (Added two more sections) and css/styles.css () files, and make the functionality of the project in js/app.js file.
## Development

- Navigation is built dynamically inside the unordered list.

- Scrolling to Section using scrollIntoView.

- Styling has been added for navbar list to make it as wanted.

- Adding classes to sections in viewport  and the highlighted navbar list item which has the name of the section in viewport.

- Styling has been added for active states.

- Styling has been added for highlighted class

- All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

- There are 5 sections that have been added to the page.

- The app.js contain two functions
  - First one (makingTheNavBar()) it make the navbar automatically according to the numer of sections and also scroll to the section when clicking on the list item which refers to it.
  - The second (AddingClasses()) which addes active class to sections on viewport and add  highlighted class to the navbar list element when it's section in viewport

- The ReadMe file dosn't have default text in it.
